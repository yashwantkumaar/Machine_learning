About Me
I am a passionate and dedicated individual with a strong foundation in programming and web development, particularly in Python. My journey in technology has been driven by my love for solving complex problems and turning innovative ideas into reality.

In my previous project, I developed a Face Recognition System, where I applied advanced algorithms to achieve accurate detection and recognition. This project allowed me to dive deep into the implementation of cutting-edge technology and gave me hands-on experience in using Python for real-world applications.

Currently, I am working on my second project in Machine Learning, focusing on predicting audience ratings for movies. This project showcases my ability to preprocess data, build predictive models, and validate their accuracy. It has been an incredible learning experience, solidifying my understanding of machine learning concepts and their practical applications.

Joining your team and company would be a dream come true as I am eager to contribute my skills, grow further in this field, and collaborate with like-minded professionals. I am deeply motivated to be part of an organization that values innovation and excellence.

I look forward to a positive reply and the opportunity to work together toward achieving great things!


About project...
üé• Predict Audience Ratings with Machine Learning

This project predicts audience ratings for movies using machine learning. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the results. The dataset used is "Rotten Tomatoes Movies."

üîç Features

Load data from an Excel file.

Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical data.

Build and train a linear regression model.

Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 Score.

Save the trained model and scaler for future use.

Generate predictions for all rows in the dataset and save the results.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used

Python

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib, seaborn

joblib

üìã How to Use

Place the dataset in the specified path.

Run the script to:

Preprocess the data.

Train the linear regression model.

Evaluate the model's performance.

Save predictions and the trained model.

Check the output files for predictions and model artifacts.

‚úÖ Validation

The model is validated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

R2 Score: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.

This project demonstrates building a machine learning pipeline to predict audience ratings efficiently.
